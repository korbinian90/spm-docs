# Compilation of SPM MEX files

!!! info "What are MEX files?"

    MEX files are MATLAB functions implemented in C/C++. Contrary to functions implemented in pure MATLAB, they need to be compiled in order for the MATLAB interpreter to be able to call them. Once compiled, they correspond to platform-specific files `*.mex*`.

## Instructions

Pre-compiled MEX files are provided with the SPM distribution so you shouldn't need to compile the MEX files yourself. We still provide here platform-specific instructions to compile all the MEX files for your machine if the shipped ones were incompatible with your OS version.

* [Windows](windows.md)
* [Linux](linux.md)
* [macOS](macos.md)

## Troubleshooting

Platform-specific throubleshooting is available with the links above. We list here error messages and solutions that are common across platforms. 

!!! failure "`bad image handle dimensions` error"

    The error "`bad image handle dimensions`" when trying to display an image is an indication that the MEX files are not compatible with your platform and should be recompiled.

## Automatic recompilation on GitHub Actions

!!! info "How is the recompilation triggered?"

    If new c files or changes are pushed to main, the [compile MEX](https://github.com/spm/spm/actions/workflows/compile_mex.yml) action will automatically run and recompile all MEX files. In can also be triggered manually, which works for a any branch.

The compiled MEX files will be available as zip a file under the [compile MEX](https://github.com/spm/spm/actions/workflows/compile_mex.yml) action by selecting the corresponding run of the action and downloading the spm-mex-all.zip file. It contains compiled MEX files for Windows, Linux, MacOS (Intel) and MacOS (Apple Silicon).

The suggested steps after changing or adding new c code is:
1. Confirm that the [automatic tests](https://github.com/spm/spm/actions/workflows/matlab.yml) still succeed
2. Download the [automatically compiled MEX files](https://github.com/spm/spm/actions/workflows/compile_mex.yml)
3. Manually add the MEX files of the corresponding change to the SPM repository (.mexa64, .mexmaca64, .mexmaci64, .mexw64)

Note: Currently, the action doesn't compile the external c dependencies. This is because of a problem of compiling the fieldtrip dependency on windows.
